## Friendship and Intimacy

### Introduction

Friendship clearly plays an important role in our life. However, people sometimes get confused and tired in an intimate relationship, and then even choose to stay far away from friendship. Whatâ€™s your idea of friendship and intimacy? Let's talk about them tonight!

### Process

The OEC (Online English Corner) will **start at 20:00, Monday** and **last for 1 hour**. There will be two roles in every round, host and other members. If you have any question (eg: cannot understand the proposition, cannot figure out the correct words, etc.), the host is there waiting to help you or you could ask for help from other members.

**Note:**

We held the OEC via **Tencent Meeting**, we suggest you to attend **10 minutes before** it starts so that you could **check your device** and get used to **open/close microphone**.
