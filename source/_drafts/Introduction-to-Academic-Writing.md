## Introducing Work

There are many ways to introduce an academic essay or short paper. Most academic writers, however, appear to do one or more of the flowing in their introducions:

-   establish the context, background and/or importance of the topic
-   present an issue, problem, or controversy in the field of study
-   define the topic and/or key terms used in the paper
-   state the purpose of the essay or short paper
-   provide an overview of the coverage and/or structure of the writing

Slightly less complex introductions may simply inform the reader: what the topic is, why it is import, and how the writing is organized. In very short assignment, it is not uncommon for a writer to commence simply by stating the purpose of their writing.

Introductions to research dissertations and theses tend to be relatively short compared to the other sections of the text but quite complex in terms of their functional elements. Some of the more common elements include:

-   establishing the context, background and/or importance to the topic
-   giving a brief review of the relevant academic literature

A number of analysts have identified common patterns in the introductions of research articles. One of the best know patterns is the CARS model (create a research space) first described by John Swales (1990). This model, which utilizes an ecological metaphor, has, in its simplest form, three elements or moves:

-   Establishing the territory (establishing importance of the topic, reviewing previous work)
-   Identifying a niche (indicating a gap in knowledge)
-   Occupying the niche (listing purpose of new research, listing questions, stating the value of the work, indicating the structure of the writing)
