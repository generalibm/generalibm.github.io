Identify flaws in arguments,

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ans</td>
<td><details><summary>Click Me</summary>This is an argument, and the conclusion is the first sentence. The evidence that those who have pets are less likely to suffer from depression and high blood pressure gives a reason to support the claim that pets are good for you, provided we can assume that it is the presence of the pet which accounts for the benefit to health. To rewrite the passage, reverse the order of the two sentences, and insert ‘so’ or ‘therefore’ before the claim that ‘pet are good for you’. </details></td>

The two claims about poor spellers are not supported by the information about good spellers, and there is no abvious connection between the two claims about the poor spellers. </details></td>

Scientists have identified genes that give some individuals an advantage in athletics, for example a gene that helps the body to use oxygen efficiently, and thus helps the muscles to work well for longer periods.</td>

<td>Ans</td>
<td><details><summary>Click Me</summary>This is an argument. The conclusion is the second sentence, and the reason given is the third sentence. The argument could be rewritten as follows:  Scientists have identified genes that give some individuals an advantage in athletics, for example a gene that helps the body to use oxygen efficiently, and thus helps the muscles to work well for longer periods. So, although training improve one’s performance in sport, and advances in the technology of sporting equipment can help athletes to break world records, this does not mean that the right training and the right equipment can help anyone to excel.</details></td>

<td>Blood donors should be paid for giving blood.</td>

<td><details><summary>Click Me</summary>The answer is c).  a) does not support the conclusion, because it suggests that the Blood Donor service may not be able to afford to pay donors. b) may look temping, but it does not support the conclusion, unless we assume that people should always be paid for helping others. It suggests that for many people, there is no need to pay them in order to motivate them to give blood. c) supports the recommendation to pay blood donors by mentioning an advantage of doing so - that is would remedy or reduce the shortage of blood donors by encouraging more people to become donors.</details></td>

<td>Some skills cannot be acquired by everyone, but everyone can develop a good personality.</td>

<td><details><summary>Click Me</summary>The answer is b). a) does not support the conclusion, because if both personalities and vital skills are subject to change, then neither applicants’ personalities nor their skills provide a good basis for choosing someone for a job. b) supports the conclusion since if employers ignore the importance of applicants’ personalities, they may appoint someone with an unsuitable personality which cannot be changed. If, however, they appoint someone with a suitable personality, they can easily teach this person the necessary skills. c) counts against the conclusion, because it suggests that personality differences between candidates are not very important (since everyone can develop a good personality), and also that for some jobs, those which involve skills which not everyone can acquire, differences between candidates in terms of their skills are very important.</details></td>

<td>c)</td>
<td>Some couples remain married simply because divorce is regarded as too expensive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ans</td>
<td><details><summary>Click Me</summary>The answer is c). a) has no impact on the conclusion, because the conclusion is about a fall in percentages, and a percentage is not affected by the total number of the group in question. b) does not support the conclusion, because it concerns a different group than the group about which the conclusion is drawn. c) supports the conclusion, because it gives a reason why people may not divorce  even if they do not have a loving marriage, and hence why the divorce rate could be falling even if the percentage of unloving marriages were not.</details></td>

<td>It is important that in bringing up children we should try to develop the quality of empathy, because those who lack it can be dangerous. For example, child molesters and psychopaths are dangerous precisely because they do not care about the suffering of others. However, children will need more than the quality of empathy in order to grow up into the kind of citizens we want, because empathy can be used in good or evil ways- for example the businessman who can use his understanding of others to inspire colleagues or in order to exploit them.</td>

If a doctor tells a patient a lie, and she finds out that she has been deceived, then the relationship of trust which is crucial for successful medical treatment will have broken down. Moreover since patients have a right to know everything about their medical condition, those patients who ask doctors about their condition should be given truthful answers to their questions.</td>
